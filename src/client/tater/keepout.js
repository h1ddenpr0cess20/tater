 * Keeps the camera out of him.

 * He is not solid. He is a skin, drawn from the outside only, and his eyes are
 * pieces sunk under it: zoom far enough into him and the skin is gone and the
 * backs of his eyes are all there is, dark blobs with their brows trailing off
 * them. So the camera stops short of the skin — of where the skin is this
 * frame, as he rocks and walks and lies down — by enough that its near plane
 * does not slice into it either.
 *
 * The body is fenced by the smallest ellipsoid round its own bounds that holds
 * all of it, in its own frame, so the fence turns, squashes and walks with it.
 * The controls are asked first where the camera goes, and it is put back on
 * the fence if that is inside; checked every frame, since he can walk into a
 * camera that is standing still.
