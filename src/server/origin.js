/**
 * Who is allowed to ask.
 *
 * Tater has no accounts and no auth, which is defensible for something you run
 * on your own machine — right up until a page you happen to have open in
 * another tab asks on your behalf. A browser attaches `Origin` to exactly the
 * requests that carry that risk: cross-site form posts, and `fetch` with a
 * content type simple enough to skip the preflight.
 *
 * So: a request that names an origin has to name ours. A request with no
 * origin is not a browser — curl, a test, a native client — and is left alone,
 * because an attacker who can already set arbitrary headers on this machine
 * has no need of the browser in the first place.
